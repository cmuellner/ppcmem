This is a tarball of our ppcmem tool for exploring the behavour 
of programs with respect to the Power and ARM memory models described here:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ppcmem/help.html

The tool can be used either from the web interface (accessible via
that link) or on the command line, building an executable from this tarball.

Note that, while some confidence in the models has been established by
experiment and discussion (as described in the associated papers),
they are not officially sanctioned by either IBM or ARM.


To build
--------

make depend_text
make text

To run
------

./ppcmem -interactive true src-ppc/MP/MP+sync+addr.litmus 

(or with any other tests from the library in src-ppc, available via the web page above, or hand-written)
